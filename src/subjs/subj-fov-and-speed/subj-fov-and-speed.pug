    p Here is an interesting fact about video games: when an object (like a car or a person) starts to accelerate, the FOV normally increases correspondingly.

    .row
        .col-md
            video.video-fluid.z-depth-1(autoplay loop muted width="100%" height="auto")
                source(src="./fov-gta.mp4" type="video/mp4")
        .col-md
            video.video-fluid.z-depth-1(autoplay loop muted width="100%" height="auto")
                source(src="./fov-spiderman.mp4" type="video/mp4")

    p

    p It seems that increasing FOV enhances the sense of speed.
    
    p Or does it?

    p I'll write a demo to find out...

    div(style={"position": "relative"})
        div#gui-fov(style={"position": "absolute", "top": "10px", "left": "10px"})
        canvas#view-fov

    p

    p Here the car speed is at constant 120 km/h, and the camera keeps the same pose, so FOV is the only thing that changes. The conclusion is obvious.

    p There's no need to the math: an object close to the camera is stretched more on the screen with larger FOV, so the speed seems to be faster.
