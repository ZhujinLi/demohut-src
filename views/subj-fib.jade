    h3 Recursion

    p The most natural way to do this is using recursive function calls:

    pre.snippet.
        def fib(x):
            if x == 0:
                return 0
            elif x == 1:
                return 1
            else:
                return fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2)

    p If we treat an addition as the basic calculation unit, we get an interesting conclusion: time complexity O(n) = fib(n - 1). Considering function call overheads in addition, this method is rather inefficient.
    
    h3 Iteration

    p If we simply transform the recursion to iteration, the time complexity reduces to linear O(n) = n:

    pre.snippet.
        def fib(x):
            a = 0
            b = 1
            for i in range(2, x + 1):
                b = a + b
                a = b - a
            return b

    p Can it be even faster?
    
    h3 Formula

    p There is a general formula for Fibonacci number calculation, and it's easy to write the code:

    pre.snippet.
        def fib(x):
            sqrt5 = 5 ** 0.5
            return int(1 / sqrt5 * (((1+sqrt5) / 2) ** x - ((1-sqrt5)/2) ** x))

    p It seems to be a O(1) solution, since pow(x, y) is of O(1) on modern CPU architectures. But if the number is too large, we have to implement the exponentiation manually. Luckily, there is a method called "exponentiation by squaring"（快速幂）, based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, that we can use to achieve log(n) complexity. 
    
    h3 Matrix

    p Can we avoid floating point calculation, while keeping the log(n) time complexity? The answer is yes:

    img(src='images/fib_matrix.png', width='60%')

    p To get the value of f(n), we need to perform exponentiation on the matrix, and obtain the first element of the result. With the same divide-and-conquer idea, this can be optimized to log(n) as well.
    
    p Code:

    pre.snippet.
        def fib(x):
            class M:
                x00 = x01 = x10 = x11 = 0

            MAT_UNIT = M()
            MAT_UNIT.x00 = 1
            MAT_UNIT.x10 = 1
            MAT_UNIT.x01 = 1
            MAT_UNIT.x11 = 0

            def mult(m1, m2):
                m = M()
                m.x00 = m1.x00 * m2.x00 + m1.x01 * m2.x10
                m.x01 = m1.x00 * m2.x01 + m1.x01 * m2.x11
                m.x10 = m1.x10 * m2.x00 + m1.x11 * m2.x10
                m.x11 = m1.x10 * m2.x01 + m1.x11 * m2.x11
                return m

            def mat(x):
                if x == 1:
                    return MAT_UNIT
                else:
                    m_sub = mat(x / 2)
                    m = mult(m_sub, m_sub)
                    if (x & 1):
                        m = mult(m, MAT_UNIT)
                    return m

            m = mat(x - 1)
            return m.x00
